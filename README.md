Scoutstrap
==========


Scoutstrap is built as an extension for the popular CSS framework [Bootstrap (2.3.2)](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/2.3.2).

It uses the colour scheme outlined over at the [Scout Brand Centre](http://scouts.org.uk/brand) and is aimed at website developers to speed up making an "on brand" site quickly and with standard UI elements.

This is currently being developed with Bootstrap 2.3.2 in mind, there are placeholders for the new Bootstrap 3.0RC1 in place but these currently do not work. It is developed in LESS as the source of Bootstrap is developed in it; and the soruce is provided along with the compiled version. There is also a showcase file to display the changes/new classes but this isn't very small screen friendly at the moment and probably will never be as it's not designed for mobile/tablet use and only as an aid to a developer.

I am currently compiling this in LESS v1.4.0 and there are known issues with Bootstrap and LESS 1.4.0 so there might be problems with some builds.
