<h1><a href="http://adamboutcher.github.io/Scoutstrap/">Scoutstrap</a></h1>
<p>Scoutstrap is a bootstrap extension for on-brand UK Scout Association Websites.</p>
<p>Scoutstrap is built as an extension to the popular CSS framework <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>, initially build for <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/">version 2.3.2</a> work is now being done to bring it into bootstrap 3.0.0 style/standards.</p>
<p>The aim of Scoutstrap is to help website developers create an &quot;on brand&quot; website for the <a href="http://scouts.org.uk/">Scout Association</a> and still be within the naming conventions and UI style of Bootstrap yet include the branding guidelines set out at the <a href="http://scouts.org.uk/brand">Scout Brand Centre</a> so websites can be quickly and easily developed for scout groups.</p>
<p>Scoutstrap started as a personal extension for a local scout group website but was open sourced so everyone can gain for the work. It <em>should</em> be compatible with all/any bootstrap based framework/templates available but obviously hasn&#39;t been rigoursly tested.</p>
<p>The bootstrap extensions are written in LESS and the source is available. I aim to include Scoutstrap extensions for both Foundation and Pure CSS frameworks eventually.</p>
