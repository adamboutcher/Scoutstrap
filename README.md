[Scoutstrap](http://adamboutcher.github.io/Scoutstrap/)
==========
Scoutstrap is a bootstrap extension for on-brand UK Scout Association Websites.


Scoutstrap is built as an extension to the popular CSS framework [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), initially build for [version 2.3.2](http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/) work is now being done to bring it into bootstrap 3.0.0 style/standards.

The aim of Scoutstrap is to help website developers create an "on brand" website for the [Scout Association](http://scouts.org.uk/) and still be within the naming conventions and UI style of Bootstrap yet include the branding guidelines set out at the [Scout Brand Centre](http://scouts.org.uk/brand) so websites can be quickly and easily developed for scout groups.

Scoutstrap started as a personal extension for a local scout group website but was open sourced so everyone can gain for the work. It *should* be compatible with all/any bootstrap based framework/templates available but obviously hasn't been rigoursly tested.

The bootstrap extensions are written in LESS and the source is available. I aim to include Scoutstrap extensions for both Foundation and Pure CSS frameworks eventually.
